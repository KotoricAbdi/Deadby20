                    <p>We are a D&D group with eight great players sitting side by side on a rectangular table role-playing and sharing great experience. We only started as a group 
                        of four (three players and one forever DM). We are in this adventure for almost 2 years and we are not tired to play it even more. 
                        For every session new things are created and amazing memories are born,
                        and old lifted up from dust. Some memes are made and some drama has happend. 
                        Money has been spent and some emotions have been bent. You can be a part of this adventure by 
                        just reading this and using you mind. If you want to know more about our campaing and the party go to "Our story" link.
